; maximum memory that OPcache can use to store compiled PHP files
opcache.memory_consumption=256

; maximum number of files that can be stored in the cache
opcache.max_accelerated_files=20000

; In production servers, PHP files should never change, unless a new application version is deployed.
; However, by default OPcache checks if cached files have changed their contents since they were cached.
; This check introduces some overhead that can be avoided as follows:
opcache.validate_timestamps=0

; maximum memory allocated to store the results
realpath_cache_size=4096K

; save the results for 10 minutes (600 seconds)
realpath_cache_ttl=600
